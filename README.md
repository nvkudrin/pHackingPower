# pHackingPower
Replication package for "(When) Can we detect p-hacking?" by Graham Elliott, Nikolay Kudrin and Kaspar Wuthrich.

File 'BWfigures.m' generates figures for analytical examples and saves them in folder BW. 

File 'Data.Generation.m' generates initial Monte Carlo draws.

File 'dgp.m' generates the non-p-hacked and p-hacked distributions for various distributions of true effects. The results are saved in folder DGPs.

File 'PowerFigures.m' generates the power curves reported in the paper.

File 'ScatterPlots.m' generates Bias-Power scatters reported in the paper. 

File 'MC_Tests.R' contains tests for p-hacking.

File 'MC_power.R' contains the function that calculates MC rejection rates for a given DGP.

File 'MC_power_main.R' replicates all Monte Carlo power curves reported in the paper.
